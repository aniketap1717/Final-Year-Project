Attendance being a pivotal part for successful student engagement, it is prioritized by almost all the schools and universities. Tracking of attendance is a crucial component while assessing the progress. Therefore, in order to ease the attendance monitoring task we came up with an Android Application system  which makes the use of Bluetooth technology on smartphones to record an individual's attendance which apparently provides time saving and cost effective attendance monitoring solution. Moreover, the system also generates daily, weekly and monthly reports along with tracking and recording attendance. Apart from recording and maintaining attendance multiple features are provided in the application which allows the instructors to set the class schedules and customize attendance thresholds which enables real time monitoring of the attendance that makes the instructor receive real time alerts if a registered person is not marked present. There is also a feature which allows the instructor to communicate with other users via emails and messaging which allows the instructors to send important notifications to other users. The other systems that are used to record attendance uses SQL and Java which are very basic and they also do not provide the feature of analyzing the attendance. Therefore making use of Bluetooth technology to develop a system is a very unique process.
